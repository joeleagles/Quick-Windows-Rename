Probably slower than doing it manually, but i wanted to test to add it to our RMM software for remote renaming

this is a simple script for renaming (changing the hostname) of windows Computers using WMIC.
for a list of error codes, check here: https://codeandkeep.com/Rename-Computer-With-WMI/

it will prompt for admin permissions, ask for a new name, and ask if you would like to restart
